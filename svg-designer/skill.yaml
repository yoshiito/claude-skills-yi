# =============================================================================
# CUSTOM SECTIONS
# =============================================================================
customSections:
  - id: core-principles
    title: Core Principles
    content: |
      1. **Grid-first**: Every design starts with a grid system
      2. **Iterate always**: Never deliver first drafts
      3. **Meaningful elements**: 3-8 elements, each with purpose
      4. **Clean structure**: Grouped elements, meaningful IDs
      5. **Accessibility**: Title, desc, aria-labels where appropriate
      6. **Scalability**: Works 16px to 1000px without modification

      ### Critical Rule: UX Authority
      **Visual style and logic must rely on UX Designer specifications.**
      - Do not invent new visual metaphors without UX approval
      - Before designing, ask for "Approved Design Source" or "UX Pattern Reference"

  - id: anti-patterns
    title: Design Anti-Patterns (AVOID)
    content: |
      | Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
      |--------------|---------|----------|
      | Letter-in-shape | Generic, forgettable | Integrate letter INTO design |
      | Unmodified defaults | Looks like clipart | Modify every shape intentionally |
      | Gradient crutch | Hides weak fundamentals | Design works in monochrome first |
      | Overly literal | No memorability | Abstract the concept |
      | Too simple (1-2 elements) | Indistinct | Add meaningful complexity |
      | Too busy (9+ elements) | Doesn't reduce | Simplify to essentials |

      See `references/professional-design-standards.md` for code examples.

      ### Basic Template

      ```svg
      <svg
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        viewBox="0 0 64 64"
        role="img"
        aria-labelledby="title desc"
      >
        <!-- Accessibility -->
        <title id="title">[Short title]</title>
        <desc id="desc">[Longer description]</desc>

        <!-- Definitions (gradients, filters, clips) -->
        <defs>
          <!-- Reusable elements here -->
        </defs>

        <!-- Main content grouped logically -->
        <g id="logo">
          <g id="icon">
            <!-- Icon paths -->
          </g>
          <g id="wordmark">
            <!-- Text/typography paths -->
          </g>
        </g>
      </svg>
      ```

      ### ViewBox Guidelines

      | Use Case | ViewBox | Grid |
      |----------|---------|------|
      | Square icon | `0 0 64 64` | 8px |
      | Wide logo | `0 0 160 64` | 8px |
      | Tall logo | `0 0 64 160` | 8px |
      | Organic | `0 0 100 61.8` | Golden |

      ### 60/30/10 Rule

      | Proportion | Role | Application |
      |------------|------|-------------|
      | 60% | Dominant | Background or main shape |
      | 30% | Secondary | Supporting elements |
      | 10% | Accent | Highlight or contrast |

      ### Common Palettes

      ```
      Trustworthy/Corporate:  #1E40AF (Blue), #1F2937 (Slate)
      Innovative/Tech:        #6366F1 (Indigo), #8B5CF6 (Violet)
      Natural/Organic:        #059669 (Emerald), #065F46 (Dark Green)

      Luxury/Premium:         #1F2937 (Near Black), #D4AF37 (Gold)
      ```

      ### Accessibility Requirements
      - Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for text elements
      - Ensure 3:1 contrast for graphic elements
      - Don't rely on color alone for meaning
      - Always provide monochrome variant

      ### Multi-Format Delivery

      1. **Primary SVG**: Full-color, scalable
