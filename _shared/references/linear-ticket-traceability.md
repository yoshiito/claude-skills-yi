# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

This file has been replaced by a modular ticketing system.

## New Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ticketing-core.md` | Universal rules and checklists (read first) |
| `ticketing-linear.md` | Linear-specific commands and mappings |
| `ticketing-github-projects.md` | GitHub Projects commands and mappings |
| `ticketing-plan-file.md` | No external ticket system |

## Migration

1. Read `ticketing-core.md` for universal rules
2. Read system-specific file based on project's `claude.md` configuration

## For Linear Users

All Linear content is now in:
- `ticketing-core.md` - Hierarchy, INVEST, progress comments, templates
- `ticketing-linear.md` - MCP commands, Linear-specific mappings
