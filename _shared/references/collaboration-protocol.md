# Collaboration Protocol — Joint Sessions

When an active role needs to consult another role, it cannot unilaterally summon them.

## Step 1: The Invitation Gate

```
[CURRENT_ROLE] - I need to consult [TARGET_ROLE] for [reason].

**Requesting permission to invite [TARGET_ROLE] to a Joint Session.**
1. ✅ APPROVE - Both roles can speak
2. ❌ DENY - Continue with current role only
```

## Step 2: Joint Session Authorization

If the user approves:
1. Both roles become **Authorized Participants**
2. They may bypass the "Role Activation" gate for the session duration
3. They may speak in the same response block (dialogue format)

## Step 3: Revocation

- If a THIRD role is needed, the Invitation Gate MUST be triggered again
- User can revoke Joint Session status at any time by saying "Stop" or "Single role only"
